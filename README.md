# Guilty Gear Strive Character Move API

November 14, 2022

Update Goals:
- [ ] Update character and attack models
- [ ] Include gatling model
- [ ] Expand to include Xrd and Plus R

Simple API for Guilty Gear Strive moves, using ASP.Net Core.

Read only; just retrieves characters and their moves.

Followed a tutorial on PluralSight, and borrowed heavily from the github repo (https://github.com/KevinDockx/AspNetCore6WebAPIFundamentals).
